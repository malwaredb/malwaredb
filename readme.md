### MalwareDB
Inspired by [VXCage](https://github.com/botherder/vxcage), MalwareDB is a malware database which does all the book-keeping regarding malware/goodware samples: hashes, origination, similarity, file types, and more. It's intention is to help malware/cybersecurity researchers, forensic investigators, and others who have a need to handle malware, or other files of potentially unknown origin. This is very much a **work in progress** and **alpha-quality** project at present.

#### Key Features:
* Store malware samples
* Categorize malware
* Fetch malware
* Search based on file similarity (requires the Postgres plugins mentioned below)
* Plugin architecture for added functionality, with a PDF plugin provided as an example.

#### Requirements:
* [Postgres](http://postgresql.org/) database server
* [Go](https://golang.org/)
* Optional:
  * [SDHash](https://github.com/sdhash/sdhash)
  * Postgres plugins enabling searches by file similarity:
    * [LZJD](https://github.com/malwaredb/LZJD)
    * [SSDeep](https://github.com/malwaredb/ssdeep_psql)
    * [SDHash](https://github.com/malwaredb/sdhash_psql)

#### Status
At present, this is a ***minimum viable product*** as not all features are currently implemented. Future updates will likely change the database schema, API, etc. But it's suitable for testing.

#### Future
* Planned features:
  * Web interface as a separate application
  * GUI applications
* Potential features:
  * Swift framework & GUI for macOS.
